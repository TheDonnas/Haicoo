<hr>
A PWA that uses a pretrained TensorFlow Model (MobileNet) for image classification and a word-finding query engine to create a haiku based on a user provided photo.

# Getting Started
```
git clone https://github.com/TheDonnas/Haicoo.git
npm install
npm start
```

## Instructions
Click upload image<br />
we will give you a haiku!<br />
...then try it again!<br />



# Key Concepts

The TensorFlow model MobileNet is loaded and saved onto the component's state. User-provided data is kept private since classifications are performed locally.

While there is no need for a persistent network connection to continue classifying images we have provided a default word bank in the case that the DataMuse API is unavailable.

Haicoo can run on a desktop platform and be <i>installed</i> on a mobile device. Our manifest file allows the app to be downloaded from a mobile deviceâ€™s browser, creating a native app experience complete with an icon on the home screen.

## Flow
* User launches progressive web application and clicks 'Get Started' or manually scrolls down to the active section of the app.
* User clicks 'Upload Image' and is prompted to choose an image saved on their device. Mobile users will be prompted to either take a photo, select a photo from their library or browse their icloud drive or other device storage options.
* The same 'Upload Image' click triggers MobileNet (a pre-trained TensorFlow model) to be loaded and stored in state.
* Image is sent to the model for classification and the top predictions are returned.
* DataMuse API calls are made with the properly formatted prediction.
* Word lists are formed through categorizing each word by its part of speech.
* A haiku is generated by utilizing the wordlists in a circular singly linked list.

# Technologies

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/): an open source JavaScript runtime environment, built on top of Chrome's V8 engine that executes JavaScript code outside of a web browser.
* [TensorFlow.js](https://www.tensorflow.org/js): an open source platform for machine learning.
* [MobileNet](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/tree/master/mobilenet): a small, low-latency, low-power model pretrained for image classification. It takes an input (such as \<img>, \<video> or \<canvas> elements) and returns an array of its top predictions along with a confidence score.
* [React](https://reactjs.org/): an open source Javascript library used for keeping UI & state in-sync. Through a comparison of a virtual DOM to the DOM, it renders components only as needed.
* [Datamuse API](http://www.datamuse.com/api/): a word-finding query engine that, given a set of constraints and a context, can return a wide variety of specific wordlists.
* [Progressive Web Apps](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/): web applications that are built to use service workers and a web app manifest to be reliable regardless of the network and even installable for a native app experience.
* [Workbox](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/workbox) a collection of JavaScript libraries for creating a PWA.

## Styling libraries

* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com): a front-end framework that uses a 12 column grid system for easy mobile-first web designs.
* [Shards](https://designrevision.com/docs/shards/): a library used on top of Bootstrap that enhances existing Bootstrap stylings.
